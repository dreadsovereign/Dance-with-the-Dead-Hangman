# Dance with the Dead Hangman

Dance with the Dead Hangman is a hangman game where the user has to guess the names of songs by the electronic/metal fusion group, [Dance with the Dead](https://dancewiththedead.bandcamp.com/)

The user has a set amount of guesses for each song title before the song will switch to another song. The user can only enter letters thanks to a JavaScript regular expression. 

For convenience, the letters already guessed will be displayed as well.
